### Hello traveller, good to see you! 

### Let me tell to you a little bit about me ☄️⚡

Right now i'm working as a Frontend Developer at Valtech, and also i'm studying Electronic Engineering at UTN (Universidad Tecnologíca Nacional).

But the since 7 months ago i've been spending the most of my time reading and learning about blockchain-based technologies, ethereum, dApps, DeFi, etc.
I strongly believe in the power of this technology to build a better and fairer world, and to change the way we interact with internet.

In this moment i've done projects following the #RoadToWeb3 run by Alchemy, also with my team won an Alchemy Hackathon with our NFT-gated voted system project.
Also, i'm member of the Ethereum Developer Program run by Platzi and the Ethereum Foundation, in which we adquire and highly improve our skills on Web3 and Ethereum Development with fullstack projects and with theory content.

The technologies which i have experience are: Solidity, JavaScript, C, React, Next.js, CSS.
But also i've been using librarys and technologies like: TailwindCSS, NextUI, Styled Components, WAGMI, Web3.js, Hardhat, Alchemy, IPFS, Firebase.

My major interest right now it's to continue improving my skills to become a Web3 Fullstack and Blockchain Developer, and also include TypeScript to my technological stack.
